# 🎬 Movie Industry Correlation Analysis

A data analysis project exploring what factors drive box office revenue in the
movie industry. The dataset covers **7,668 movies released between 1980 and 2020**
and examines relationships between budget, gross revenue, IMDb scores, genres,
content ratings, production companies, and more.

## 📌 Project Overview

This project was built to answer key questions about the movie industry:

- Does a bigger budget guarantee more revenue?
- Do higher-rated films earn more at the box office?
- Which production companies dominate gross revenue?
- Which genres are most profitable, and has that changed over the decades?
- Which films delivered the best return on investment regardless of budget size?

## 🔧 Project Workflow

### 1. Setup & Data Loading
- Imported `pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`, and `seaborn`
- Loaded dataset using a relative path for portability across machines

### 2. Data Inspection
- Previewed data with `head()`, `info()`, and `describe()`
- Confirmed 7,668 rows across 15 columns

### 3. Data Quality Checks
- Identified and reported missing values per column
- Detected and removed duplicate rows
- Visualised outliers in gross revenue using a box plot
- Replaced `budget = 0` with `NaN` (~28% of rows had zero budgets
  representing missing data, not actual zero-cost productions)

### 4. Feature Engineering
- Extracted `release_year` from the `released` date string using
  `pd.to_datetime()` for robustness
- Created a `decade` column (e.g. `1990s`) for genre trend grouping
- Computed `roi = (gross - budget) / budget` on rows with known budget values

### 5. Exploratory Visualisations
- Budget vs Gross — scatter plot and regression plot
- IMDb Score vs Gross — regression plot
- Content Rating vs Gross — strip plot

### 6. Correlation Analysis
- Pearson correlation on numeric features only
  (`select_dtypes(include='number')`)
- Label-encoded all categorical columns on a separate copy (`df_encoded`)
  to avoid corrupting the original dataframe
- Pearson correlation on all features (encoded)
- Heatmaps with masked upper triangle, `coolwarm` colormap, and annotations
- Identified strongly correlated feature pairs (`|r| > 0.5`)

### 7. Revenue Analysis
- Top 15 production companies by total gross revenue
- Top 15 company-year combinations
- Top 15 movies by ROI — reveals low-budget films often outperform
  blockbusters on a relative basis
- Average gross revenue by genre per decade (1980s–2010s)
- Overall top 5 genres by average gross

## 📈 Key Findings

| Finding | Detail |
|---|---|
| Strongest correlator with gross | **Budget** (r ≈ 0.71) |
| Weakest correlator with gross | **IMDb Score** (r ≈ 0.17) |
| Missing budget data | ~28% of rows had `budget = 0`, treated as missing |
| High-ROI films | Tend to be low-budget horror and thriller productions |
| Dataset size | 7,668 rows (original notebook used 6,820) |
